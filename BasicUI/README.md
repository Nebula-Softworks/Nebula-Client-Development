A super basic User Interface for Nebula Client that is made to be very lightweight.  
It is meant to be the simpler alternative to celestia, being a basic window with a textbox and buttons.  
Design is Native to Windows 11, and follows Microsoft's Fluent Design, including the Mica effect.  
  
To use, download the project and compile it. it will appear in `bin\debug`.  
You will still need to Install the Nebula Trinity Engine.
